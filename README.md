## Summary

This is tool to send quick website postcards to people.

## Use

- Local development with `make dev`
- For a new recipient: duplicate a recipient directory and edit the files within.
- GitHub or Cloudflare Pages are easy because of the static file paths.
- The deployed site is in another repo for privacy. I'd love to hear your ideas about consolidating frictionlessly.
